> **Academic Notice:** This research initiative is an ongoing **Undergraduate Bachelor's Thesis Proposal** at Daffodil International University. It represents active theoretical formulation and formal modeling rather than a defended dissertation or clinical trial.

## Proposal Overview

Patients suffering from comorbid Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and Heart Failure (HF) exist at the epicenter of therapeutic conflict. Clinical guidelines are historically authored in disease silos:
* **KDIGO** (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) dictates renoprotective targets.
* **ADA** (American Diabetes Association) prescribes glycemic thresholds and SGLT2i indications.
* **ACC/AHA** (American College of Cardiology) specifies neurohormonal blockade.

When co-prescribed, pharmacodynamic interactions (e.g., ACE inhibitors combined with ARBs and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) create perilous risks of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. This thesis proposes a formal verification framework encoding heterogeneous guideline propositions into Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT).

## Research Questions & Formal Objectives

1. **Formal Encoding:** Can heterogeneous multi-society guidelines expressed in natural language be translated into decidable First-Order Logic (FOL) fragments without loss of clinical intent?
2. **Automated Conflict Detection:** Can an SMT solver (Microsoft Z3) deterministically uncover latent contradictions between concurrent guideline recommendations for multimorbid patient states in sub-second runtime?
3. **Counterexample Generation:** In cases of unsatisfiable regimens (`UNSAT`), can the solver automatically generate minimally disruptive alternative dosing parameters?

## Methodological Framework

The project constructs a formalization pipeline:
1. **Predicate Extraction:** Isolating biomarker boundary domains (eGFR, serum creatinine, potassium, ejection fraction, HbA1c).
2. **SMT Axiomatization:** Encoding guideline logic as conjunctions of implications over non-linear real and integer arithmetic.
3. **Solver Integration:** Verifying global satisfiability using the Z3 solver backend.

```python
# Formal Representation of Polypharmacy Conflict (Sample Theory)
from z3 import *

egfr = Real('egfr')
serum_k = Real('serum_k')
ras_inhibitor = Bool('ras_inhibitor')
mra = Bool('mra')

solver = Solver()

# Patient Context: Advanced CKD with Hyperkalemia
solver.add(egfr < 30.0)
solver.add(serum_k > 5.2)

# ACC Guideline: Indication for Heart Failure
solver.add(mra == True)

# KDIGO Safety Invariant: MRA + RASi contraindication when K+ > 5.0 or eGFR < 30
safety_invariant = Implies(
    And(mra, serum_k > 5.0),
    Not(ras_inhibitor)
)
solver.add(safety_invariant)

# Verifying if dual therapy is satisfiable
solver.add(ras_inhibitor == True)

# Returns UNSAT: Proves formal incompatibility of simultaneous therapy
assert solver.check() == unsat
```
